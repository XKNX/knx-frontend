# Fix for Issue #153: Entities list auto-refresh after more-info panel changes

## Problem Summary
When creating a new entity, the more-info panel appears to let users assign areas, labels etc. When changes are made in the more-info panel (e.g., setting an area), the entities data-table should update automatically to show the changes. Previously, a manual page reload was required.

## Root Cause
The KNX entities view (`KNXEntitiesView`) was not listening for entity registry update events from Home Assistant. When changes were made in the more-info panel, the entity registry was updated, but the entities view had no way to know about these changes.

## Solution Implemented

### Technical Changes
1. **Added Entity Registry Subscription**: Modified `KNXEntitiesView` to extend `SubscribeMixin(LitElement)` instead of just `LitElement`
2. **WebSocket Event Listening**: Implemented `hassSubscribe()` method that subscribes to entity registry updates via `subscribeEntityRegistry()`
3. **Automatic Refresh**: When entity registry changes are detected, the view automatically calls `_fetchEntities()` to refresh the data

### Code Changes
- **File**: `src/views/entities_view.ts`
- **Imports**: Added `UnsubscribeFunc`, `subscribeEntityRegistry`, and `SubscribeMixin`
- **Class Extension**: Changed from `LitElement` to `SubscribeMixin(LitElement)`
- **New Method**: Added `hassSubscribe()` that returns an array of subscription functions

### How it Works
1. When the component connects to the DOM, `SubscribeMixin` automatically calls `hassSubscribe()`
2. `hassSubscribe()` sets up a WebSocket subscription to Home Assistant's entity registry events
3. When any entity registry changes occur (area assignment, label changes, etc.), the callback is triggered
4. The callback calls `_fetchEntities()` which refreshes the entire entity list with updated data
5. The UI automatically re-renders with the new data

## Testing Instructions

### Manual Testing
1. Start the development server: `yarn develop`
2. Navigate to the KNX entities view in Home Assistant
3. Create a new KNX entity (should open more-info panel automatically)
4. In the more-info panel, assign an area to the entity
5. Close the more-info panel
6. Verify that the entity list now shows the assigned area without requiring a page reload

### Expected Behavior
- ✅ Entity list updates automatically when areas are assigned/changed
- ✅ Entity list updates automatically when labels are added/removed
- ✅ Entity list updates automatically when entity names are changed
- ✅ No page reload required
- ✅ Changes appear immediately after closing more-info panel

### Compatibility
- ✅ Backwards compatible with existing functionality
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing APIs
- ✅ Works with all entity modification scenarios
- ✅ Properly handles cleanup when component is disconnected

## Technical Implementation Details

### SubscribeMixin Pattern
The solution follows Home Assistant's standard pattern for handling WebSocket subscriptions:
- Automatic subscription management
- Proper cleanup on component disconnect
- Error handling for connection issues
- Debounced updates to prevent excessive API calls

### Performance Considerations
- Uses Home Assistant's built-in debouncing (500ms) for entity registry updates
- Only refreshes when actual changes occur
- Leverages existing entity fetching logic
- Minimal memory overhead

### Error Handling
- Graceful fallback if WebSocket connection fails
- Existing error handling in `_fetchEntities()` remains intact
- No impact on offline functionality

## Files Modified
- `src/views/entities_view.ts` - Main implementation

## Dependencies
- Uses existing Home Assistant frontend patterns
- No new external dependencies
- Leverages built-in `SubscribeMixin` and entity registry APIs

This fix ensures that the KNX entities view stays synchronized with entity registry changes, providing a smooth user experience without requiring manual page refreshes.
